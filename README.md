# AI-Driven-Alloy-Addition-System
We developed a hybrid, human-in-the-loop decision support platform that converts real-time spectrometer data into, kilogram-level alloy correction recommendations. Our system combines industry-based metallurgical rules with machine learning models (using XGBoost and TensorFlow) to predict the exact quantity of alloys needed with high confidence.
